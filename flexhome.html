        <p class="p2">If it’s Friday night in Wisconsin, chances are Wisconsinites are trying to answer one question, and one question only: “Where am I getting fish fry tonight?”
        The classic Wisconsin fish fry is a significant part of our state’s food culture. Ask any Wisconsinite about their favorite, and you’re bound to get a detailed list, typically ranked on the basis of bar or restaurant atmosphere, fish and breading type, seasonings and quality of side dishes.</p>

   <div><h2 class="h2-2">How It Started!</h2>
    <p class="p2">In Wisconsin, freshwater fish like walleye, perch and bluegill were plentiful and cheap. During the years of Prohibition, selling plates of fish was a way for taverns around the state to stay afloat financially. In the mid-1960s, the Catholic church changed the rules around abstaining from animal meat every Friday of the year and just required parishioners to do so on Fridays during Lent, but by then, “going out for fish” on Fridays was simply an integral part of Wisconsin life.</p>
